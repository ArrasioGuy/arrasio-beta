# arrasio-beta
This repository is mainly made by Nepphhhh all code also, it has some bugfixes and changes, especially one info update in the changelog, feel free to bugfix this more and make pull requests. You can probably use this to make your own arras.io beta servers. (Original Repo: https://github.com/Nepphhh/arrasio )

## To start the server
You need node.js
Open cmd in the folder and type these commands:
- npm i ws
- npm i google-closure-library
- node src/server/server.js
these two should be enough, atleast they worked for me. If the server won't turn on or gives an error um, i've fucked up something then-

If you want to help me (and excel?) run the server and find bugs and fix them, help will be appreciated. Most of the bugs are in `src/client/js/app.js`


Feel free to fork/use as an template.
